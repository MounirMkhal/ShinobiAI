            <p class="paragraph description">The narrative of the AI system is inspired by Japanese history, specifically the Shinobi period—The Way of the Warrior—but it has been adapted into a universe of intelligent agents. The concept draws from the legend of the samurai Shinmen Takezō, a renowned Japanese swordsman celebrated for his innovative techniques and dual-sword fighting style. Shinmen Takezō is also credited as the author of "Gorin no Sho" ("The Book of Five Rings")—a work that outlines the elements of strategy through Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Void. These same elements serve as the foundational archetypes by which the AI agents are categorized within the Shinobi-inspired AI universe.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph description">In 17th century Japan during a bloody war between the samurai, Shinmen
                Takezō, one of the most feared samurai, was defeated by a huge army, the Ashigaru, who planned to
                assassinate him. He was captured, but soon he managed to escape from the samurai`s hands with serious
                injuries. When Takezo comes back to his village he notices that his home was totally destroyed and not
                even a villager could be found. His only goal from that moment was to become an avenger and defeat the
                Ashigaru army, which destroyed his native village. After a few training sessions,  the samurai realizes
                that because of his injuries he will never fight like he used to. His only solution was to create on his
                own &quot;the will&quot;, a handful of fighters to train and carry out his wish. He creates five
                fighters, each of them representing a natural element:<br />GI embodies the element of fire.<br />Rei
                impersonates the element of earth.<br />Makoto represents the element of wind.<br />Meiyo emblematizes
                the element of water.<br />Jin personifies the void.<strong><br />‍</strong><br />For 10 years the five
                warriors were trained by the samurai Takezō. Seeing that he managed to teach them everything he knew
                about the Art of Fighting and the Art of War, he decided to say goodbye. Due to his age, he knew that
                his time on Earth was limited, so Takezō decided to retire to the Fuji Mountains. Knowing that there he
                will find his eternal home, he dies in peace as his Shinobi Samurai will complete his mission.</p><img

            <p class="paragraph description">After Takezō&#x27;s retreat, the Shinobi Samurai remain in Azuka Village to
                train. This village was mostly lacking of samurai and become a peaceful village in the Japan territory.
                Nevertheless,  GI, who is considered the leader and in charge of the five, was attacked on a cold
                evening by a handful of disguised samurai that came to the village specifically to attack
                him.<br /><strong>‍</strong><br />After a tough battle, GI realizes that his brothers may have suffered
                just as much as him. Noticing this thought, he rushes to his brothers’ home. On his way to that
                location, Gi observes that he is being followed by a number of samurai who had the same appearance.
                Shortly after, he sees an explosion in the area where his brothers were supposed to be, then he realizes
                that Azuka is under attack.<br /></p><img

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph description">The attack on the village has expanded, Azuka was being hit from more and
                more sides. It was certainly meant to target and damage the village. Knowing his brothers are in danger,
                GI has a rampage, willing to destroy his opponents, who will be killed without a chance. Once he arrived
                at the location where his brothers were supposed to be staying, he noticed that the building was
                destroyed, and he was surrounded by explosions and screams from the villagers. Gi realizes that he may
                have lost his brothers and unleashes his Fire Shinobi power, a power that causes him to lose control
                destroying everything surrounding him. The attackers didn&#x27;t even have a chance to get close to him,
                Gi being the strongest Shinobi fighter.<br /><strong>‍</strong><br />Soon he is shouted at by three of
                his brothers who ask Gi to retreat with them. The four manage to find a secluded road that leads to the
                exit of Azuka Village. Once they get to a safe place, the three tell him that, just like Gi, they have
                been attacked by a large number of unidentified samurai. Those samurai were also the ones that destroyed
                the building where the 4 Gi&#x27;s brothers were. Unfortunately, the building collapsed with one of
                them, Jin. He was left in the wreckage of the building, the other 3 escaping with minor injuries.
                Hearing this, Gi vows to take revenge with his brothers on those who attacked the village and retrieve
                their brother Jin.<br /></p><img

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph description">Meanwhile, the samurai who attacked the village retrieve Jin, who was in an
                unconscious state, from under the remains of the building and take him to an isolated place to recover.
                After a few days, Jin wakes up in a bed, in a dark room, and soon one of the attackers visit him. Due to
                the different appearance he had compared to the day of the Attacks, it was impossible for Jin to
                recognize him.<br />‍<br />The mysterious person who greets Jin tells him what happened, claiming that
                his brothers abandoned him and now they are considered fugitive samurai. Furthermore, he says that the
                authorities of the Japan territory are after them and he has nothing to do with the attackers that
                resulted in his injury. Jin was always the weak link among the five, being the most easily influenced
                and vulnerable. After everything he hears he chooses to help the mysterious man, capturing his brothers,
                with the sad thought that they abandoned him in the fight.<br /><strong>‍</strong><br />Therefore, the
                five Shinobi brothers were now divided into two camps: Gi, Rei, Makoto and Meiyo, the brothers who now
                they were considered fugitive samurai and were being hunted by all authorities because that attack was
                staged on them by the Ashigaru army, and Jin who was fooled to fight against his own brothers. The young
                samurai are seeking revenge on the Ashigaru army as they are looking for their brother. The other camp
                is made up of Jin and the Ashigaru army, who follow the trail of the four samurai.<br /></p><img
